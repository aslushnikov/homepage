    | Here are projects I've done during last 10 years of programming. Among them
    | are some really old things that I just like, and some really modern ones.
    | Every non-commercial project is provided with its source code so you can
    | grasp into it if you like.

    | All sources are provided as-is; use them on your
    | own risk (if you're ever going to).
