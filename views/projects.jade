  | Here are projects I've done during last 10 years of programming. Among them
  | are some really old things that I just like, and some really modern ones.
  | Every non-commercial project is provided with its source code so you can
  | grasp into it if you like.
p
  | All sources are provided as-is; use them on your
  | own risk (if you're ever going to).
