  <p>This is my diploma project. This is a web-based 3D-model viewer/editor
  with the following options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Load model stored in a OBJ file</li>
    <li>Rotate, scale model</li>
    <li>Edit model geometry with a deformation tool</li>
    <li>Execute a server-side filter on the geometry</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The last option is my favourite one. It is a powerful tool and you can make
  use of it in a many ways. Here are some application:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Embed legacy code from old projects</li>
    <li>Implement filters with hidden proprietary code in whatever language you
    like (almost 20 potentionally supported)</li>
    <li>Move some heavy deformation algorithms to server-side to speed up the
    process</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The server computations are blazingly fast and work fine even over 3G
  connection.</p>
  <p>The diploma got an excellent mark. You can check out the text and
  presentation of diploma <a href="https://github.com/aslushnikov/diplom-latex">here</a>
