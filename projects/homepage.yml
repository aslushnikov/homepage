  The homepage is written from scratch and is based on the
  Node.js platform. I don't use any CMS or anything like this because
  I love the process of webdev, so it's kind of hobby for me
  to update the site and develop it from time to time.

  Btw there's an ability to control site sections via 1-5 keyboard buttons
