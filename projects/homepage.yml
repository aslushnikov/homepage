  <p>
  The homepage is written from scratch and is based on the Node.js platform. The
  reason I chose this hard way instead of using some kind of CMS is that I
  simply love coding, so it's kind of hobby for me to update the site and
  develop it from time to time.

  <p>
  The first public version of the site had a nasty design because I did it
  on my own. But then <a href='http://vk.com/deer_huntress'>Maria Vlasova</a>
  was kind enough to help me with the look-and-feel; I hope you guys like the new
  version much more.

  please, let me know about it via <a

  <p>
  And "one more thing": all your activity on the site is tracked via Google
  Analytics. I know nobody cares, but it looks like I have to warn you
  about the fact.
