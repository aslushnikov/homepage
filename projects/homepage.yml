  The homepage is written from scratch and is based on the
  Node.js platform. I don't use any CMS or anything like this because
  I love the process of webdev with the platform, so it's kind of hobby
  for me to update the site.

  Btw there's an ability to control site sections via 1-5 keyboard buttons
