  The game was made exclusively for some IT company. They
  wanted an html5 chess with offline AI strong enough to win in a game
  with average user. The most challenging were deadlines: the work had to be
  done in a <strong>couple of days</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  The game maintains almost all chess rules, including:
  <ul>
  <li>En passant
  <li>Restriction to castle if the king crosses the beaten cell
  </ul>
  The only one <strong>not maintained</strong> is an abitily to choose a desired
  piece when the pawn reaches the last row; intead a queen is put on the desk.

  Unfortunately I can't share sources as the project was made on commercial
  basis, but you're free to challenge AI :)
