  <p>The game was made exclusively for some IT company. They
  wanted a html5 chess game with offline AI strong enough to win in a game
  with average user. The most challenging were deadlines: the game had to be
  done in a <strong>couple of days</strong></p>
  <p>Unfortunately I can't share sources as the project was made on commercial
  basis, but you're free to challenge AI :)</p>
