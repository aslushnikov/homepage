  The game is probably the ugliest one among that bunch of games I did for my
  classmates (and I can't assume any reason for that). Nevertheless, it finally
  got an excellent mark, and everyone was happy
  </p>

  The game is a snake emulation. There are two kinds of food it can eat: standart one
  and a super-food which gives more points (just like Snake II on old Nokia).
  The super-food is what you can see on the screenshot. The progress bar reflects
  amount of time left for you to eat the super food, or it will disappear.

  The game doesn't have a records table, but it persists a single best score with a
  name of the hero.

  The game works fine under windows and there are regular encoding troubles when
  launched under <code>wine</code>
