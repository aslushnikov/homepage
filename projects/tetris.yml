  This project was made in a big hurry as a coursework for my classmate in
  school. This is Just Another Tetris game, this time written in Delphi.
  </p>
  <p>
  The game is not original in any way: you can rotate the piece that is
  falling down from the top of the glass, the completed lines are removed, and
  the gameplay speeds up as you are not dying for more and more time. There is a
  persistent records table (summoned via F9), help page (F1) and new game
  options.
  </p>
  <p>
  The game runs fine on Windows, but there are encoding-troubles if you try to
  run it through <code>wine</code>.
