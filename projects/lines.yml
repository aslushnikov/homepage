  Meet Just Another Lines game, written in Delphi.
  This project was made as a coursework for my classmate.

  The one has super-simplistic graphics, but it has some kind of animation
  when you get five-in-a-row :) It doesn't have a record table, but it persists
  a single best score and name of the hero.

  The game works fine under Windows, but there is an encoding bug I encountered
  while running it under <code>wine</code>.
