  The project was made during <a href="http://www.hackday.ru">Hackday</a>.
  During the <b>2-days</b> event, programmers were doing prototypes
  and presented them in the end of the second day.

  Our project was some kind of language cards to effectively store and learn
  unknown english words. The project was built out of four parts: rest server
  (my responsobility), web client (<a href="http://udalov.org">Alex Udalov</a>),
  iOS client (<a href="http://vk.com/mortigenus">Vania Chalov<a>) and Android client
  (developed by <a href="http://vk.com/xvorsx">Sergey Vorobyev</a>). All design
  was made very fast by <a href="http://vk.com/deer_huntress">Maria Vlasova</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  ByHeart finally <b>won a prize</b> as the most technically finished project
  (Description, photos and results are available
  <a href="http://hackday.ru/events/hackday-16/report.html">here</a>).
  But because of such services like <a href="http://wordsteps.com">WordSteps</a>
  and <a href="http://lingualeo.ru">LinguaLeo</a> that fully cover ByHeart's
  functionality its further development was
  stopped.
