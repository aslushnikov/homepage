  Our project was some kind of language cards to effectively store and learn
  unknown english words. The project was built out of four parts: rest server
  (my responsobility), web client (<a href="http://udalov.org">Alex Udalov</a>),
  iOS client (<a href="http://vk.com/mortigenus">Vania Chalov<a>) and Android client
  (developed by <a href="http://vk.com/xvorsx">Sergey Vorobyev</a>). All design
  was made very fast by <a href="http://vk.com/deer_huntress">Maria Vlasova</a>

  photos and results are available
