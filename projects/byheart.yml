  The project was made during <a href="http://www.hackday.ru">Hackday</a>.
  During the <b>2-days</b> event, programmers were doing prototypes
  and presented them in the end of the second day.

  <p>
  Our project was some kind of language cards to effectively store and learn
  unknown english words. The project was built out of four parts:
  <ul>
  <li>rest server (my responsobility)
  <li>web client (<a href="http://udalov.org">Alex Udalov</a>),
  <li>iOS client (<a href="http://vk.com/mortigenus">Vania Chalov<a>)
  <li>Android client
  (developed by <a href="http://vk.com/xvorsx">Sergey Vorobyev</a>)
  </ul>All design
  was made by <a href="http://vk.com/deer_huntress">Maria Vlasova</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  ByHeart finally <b>won a prize</b> as the most technically finished project
  (description, photos and results are available
  <a href="http://hackday.ru/events/hackday-16/report.html">here</a>).
  But because of such services like <a href="http://wordsteps.com">WordSteps</a>
  and <a href="http://lingualeo.ru">LinguaLeo</a> that fully cover ByHeart's
  functionality its further development was
  stopped.
