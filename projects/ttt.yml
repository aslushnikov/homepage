  Just Another Tic-Tac-Toe game made for fun. This one is
  written entirely in java (read: crossplatform!) and supports dozen
  of features:
  <ul>
    <li>Network game
    <li>Two AIs of different difficulties
    <li>Half-extendable AI interface to write you own (I said "half" because you
    should patch gui.SelectPlayer as well)
    <li>Game log that could be saved and loaded
    <li>Chat for network game
    <li>Hot-seat game
    <li>View customization
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  To get all this things working on Windows, you should double click on
  <code>TTT.bat</code> which you'll find in <code>bin</code> directory.
  </p>
  <p>
  On Unix-like machines things are a bit harder 'cause I didn't create any
  shortcut for launching. You'll have to open terminal, <code>cd</code> to
  the <code>bin</code> directory, and run <code>java gui.MainFrame</code>
  </p>
  <p>
  And yes, there's one known bug that I figured out today: the game log
  supports mouse interaction, but don't do it: the whole thing hangs!
