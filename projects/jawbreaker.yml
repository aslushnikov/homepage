  The game was a default one on the Windows 6.5 Mobile and had the same name
  there. The idea of the game is to destroy topologically-connected balls of the
  same color (it's not possible to destroy a single ball). The more balls in the
  group, the more score you get. You can check the score of the group by selecting
  it via right-button mouse click: the score will be displayed in the bottom-right
  corner.

  The game has two game modes: classic and arcade. In the classic mode, the empty
  space left after destroyed balls is not filled with new ones, but in arcade
  mode it does.

  The game works fine both under Windows and Wine.
