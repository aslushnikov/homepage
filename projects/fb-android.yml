  During my internship in Facebook I was developing Facebook for Android application.
  The are couple of features I implemented for it that were included in production,
  and here I will share a few words about them with you.
  </p>
  <p>
  The first one I call "popups". Popup is a small iPad-like dialog that appears
  when you click over notification jewels (you can see it opened on the left-most
  screenshot)
  </p>
  <p>
  Second one is "make profile picture" button. It allows you to take any picture,
  crop it in any way you like and set it up as a profile pic. Cropping supports
  multitouch.
  </p>
  <p>
  Third one is "search" bar that you see in the top of navigation panel (you can
  see it on the right-most screenshot). I didn't implemenent design, but did the
  functionality of the thing.
