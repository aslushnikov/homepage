  In 2011 I spent some time in Facebook developing their "Facebook for Android"
  application. I had plenty of different sub-projects related to the app, and
  some of them were even included later in production. Here I will share a few
  words about them.
  </p>
  <p>
  The first one I call "popups". Popup is a small iPad-like dialog that appears
  when you click over notification jewels (you can see it opened on the left-most
  screenshot)
  </p>
  <p>
  Second one is "make profile picture" functionality. It allows you to take any picture,
  crop it in any way you like and set it up as a profile pic. Cropping supports
  multitouch.
  </p>
  <p>
  Third one is "search" bar that you see in the top of navigation panel (you can
  see it on the right-most screenshot). I didn't implemenent design, but carried
  out the functionality of the thing.
