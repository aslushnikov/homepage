  <p>
  This is a small service developed to compile latex documents online.
  The slogan is: <i>You give it a link, it gives you PDF</i>. The service
  has a REST API, so if you have a TeX file publicly shared somewhere on the
  web, then you can create a link using this service on the PDF of the file.
  </p>
  <p>
  Service evolved and now has additional functionality.
  It can build a TeX documents stored in git repositories, and additionally
  it provides a tool for remote compilation from the command-line. The last
  gives you an opportunity to avoid installing tex packages on your working machine.
