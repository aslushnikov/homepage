  The project was part of my summer <a href="http://bioinf.spbau.ru/en/">Academic
  University</a> internship, and a paper about results is going to be published.
  </p>
  <p>
  The idea was to implement a morphing server for proteins using the
  on-line algorithm proposed by Pavel Pevzner and Natalie Castellana. So the project
  is made out of three parts:
  <ul>
    <li>web-face
    <li>algorithm implementation/optimization
    <li> WebGL-based client for rendering and animating morphing results
  </ul>
  Unfortunately on the moment of Mar, 2012 the entire algorithm seems to be
  rewritten because my implementation sucked. But the good thing is that
  two other parts are still my things :)
