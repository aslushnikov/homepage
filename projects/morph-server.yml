  <p>The idea was to implement a morphing server for proteins using the
  on-line algorithm proposed by Pavel Pevzner and Natalie Castellana. So the project
  is made out of three parts: web-face, algorithm implementation/optimization and
  WebGL-based client for rendering and animation morphing results.
  </p>
  <p>On the moment of Mar, 2012 the algorithm seems to be rewritten (my
  implementation sucked)</p>
  <p>The project was part of my summer <a href="http://bioinf.spbau.ru/en/">Academic
  University</a> internship, and
  a paper about results is going to be published</p>
start: Apr, 2011
