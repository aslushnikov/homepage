  Meet my <strong>favourite</strong> project among all I've done for my
  classmates: MineSweeper!
  </p>
  <p>
  Minesweeper is the only one that has <strong>sprites</strong> for rendering
  graphics, so it doesn't look as awkward as other do (the only exception is
  tetris where graphics seems to be pretty natural). The game
  supports various field sizes, starting from 10x10 and up to 40x40. It has
  auto-open functionality (green cells on screenshot are auto-opened). Mouse's
  right button is bound to toggle question mark and mine flag just like the
  original windows version does.
  </p>
  <p>
  The bad thing is that during todays' testing I figured out a really hideous
  bug: the game doesn't seem to work when you try to launch it on a field size
  other then 40x40. Probably that's because I forgot to flush some variables
  inside in the code :(
  <br/>
  The good thing is that the true professionals play 40x40 only, don't we? :)
  </p>

  As always, the game runs fine on Windows, but there are problems with encoding
  under <code>wine</code>
