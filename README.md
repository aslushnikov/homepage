## Installation

I suppose you have `node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.
In this case, installation is done in one step:

`git checkout https://github.com/aslushnikov/homepage`

And after that, `cd` to the project directory and install
all dependencies

`npm install`

## What's the thing?

I planned it as a homepage and did it for fun, and here it is: my *naive CMS*.

Here's only one kind of documents: projects. Their description is done via
YAML-files, which you can find in folder `./projects`

The list of all files and their order is determined by `./projects/list.yml`

You might ask me: why YAML? Two reasons: it's not bad for the purpose and I
really like it.

## Should I use this for my own homepage?

The code wasn't written for someone to reuse, but I didn't obfuscate
anything, so you may try :)
